    !* -- 3D Roe's Flux Function and Jacobian --
    !*
    !* NOTE: This version does not use any tangent vector.
    !*       See "I do like CFD, VOL.1" about how tangent vectors are eliminated.
    !*
    !* This subroutine computes the Roe flux for the Euler equations
    !* in the direction, njk=[nx,ny,nz].
    !*

    !* Schemes, Journal of Computational Physics, 43, pp. 357-372.
    !*
    !* Conservative form of the Euler equations:
    !*
    !*     dU/dt + dF/dx + dG/dy + dH/dz = 0
    !*
    !* This subroutine computes the numerical flux for the flux in the direction,
    !* njk=[nx,ny,nz]:
    !*
    !*     Fn = F*nx + G*ny + H*nz = | rho*qn          |
    !*                               | rho*qn*u + p*nx |
    !*                               | rho*qn*v + p*ny |
    !*                               | rho*qn*w + p*nz |
    !*                               | rho*qn*H        |    (qn = u*nx + v*ny + w*nz)
    !*
    !* The Roe flux is implemented in the following form:
    !*
    !*   Numerical flux = 1/2 [ Fn(UR) + Fn(UL) - |An|dU ], 
    !*
    !*  where
    !*
    !*    An = dFn/dU,  |An| = R|Lambda|L, dU = UR - UL.
    !*
    !* The dissipation term, |An|dU, is actually computed as
    !*
    !*     sum_{k=1,4} |lambda_k| * (LdU)_k * r_k,
    !*
    !* where lambda_k is the k-th eigenvalue, (LdU)_k is the k-th wave strength,
    !* and r_k is the k-th right-eigenvector evaluated at the Roe-average state.
    !*
    !* Note: The 4th component is a combined contribution from two shear waves.
    !*       They are combined to eliminate the tangent vectors.
    !*       So, (LdU)_4 is not really a wave strength, and
    !*       r_4 is not really an eigenvector.
    !*       See "I do like CFD, VOL.1" about how tangent vectors are eliminated.
    !*
    !* Note: In the code, the vector of conserative variables are denoted by uc.

    !* Note: This subroutine has been prepared for an educational purpose.
    !*       It is not at all efficient. Think about how you can optimize it.
    !*       One way to make it efficient is to reduce the number of local variables,
    !*       by re-using temporary variables as many times as possible.
    !*
    !* Note: Please let me know if you find bugs. I'll greatly appreciate it and
    !*       fix the bugs.
