A new version of my personal CFD project (KCFD) that will hopefully be written in a way that is easier to modify (and named after my cat).

Much of the backbone of this code is based on the free educational codes provided by Katate Masatsuka (AKA Dr. Hiroaki Nishikawa).  I have made minimal changes to the setup sections of his code (importing settings, building the 
grid associations, etc.) so that I can focus on the stuff that is more interesting to me, namely the numerics.  His code can be found at http://ossanworld.com/cfdbooks/cfdcodes.html.
