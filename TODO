Allocate jacobian in a jacobian module (was in the construct grid data which doesn't make sense now)
Poetentially add weighting to the cell gradient average step.



MMS trouble shooting:
1) mms_include(3) = .true. gets second orter convergence (for momentum).
    this bypasses the flux functions and hand calculates the momentum flux.
    The method of adding the flux to the residual is good.!
2) mms_include(3) = .true. with exact face gradients (and no even-odd decoupling) is identical to 1).
    This implies that if the face gradient is correct, the flux function is correct.
    So the issue lies with the face gradient that is being calculated.

Possible problems:
    Incorrect implementation of the decoupling (seems unlikely)
    Correct implementation but it's not O(h**2). (seems unlikely)
    Need a better method for the boundary gradient (maybe?)
    other?


OK ya it seems like it's just O(h)?  I dunno, anyways, the energy equation seems to be converging.  It may have been a bug in how I computed F5 that was small but significant.  I've tested it with the numerical flux values at internal cells and it's good.  Boundary faces are next to test.

OK we get second order convergence of the energy viscous terms but not the momentum terms.  Not really sure why.  I suppose the next step would be to run this on an irregular grid and see how things behave...
