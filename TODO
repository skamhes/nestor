Allocate jacobian in a jacobian module (was in the construct grid data which doesn't make sense now)
Poetentially add weighting to the cell gradient average step.


Idea for speeding up the gradient computation: vecotrize the lsq computations.  Need to think about the structure of this a little.

Turb computations are good through the flow residuals.  Next is the turb residuals.
